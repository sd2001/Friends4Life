To celebrate this precious relationship of friendship on the upcoming International Friendship Day, we bring a deep learning challenge to you: #FriendshipGoals. The Anthropology department of an Ivy League school is planning to study the impact of friendship at different life stages. You have been hired as a deep learning specialist to assist their team in this project.

Your task is to build a deep learning model that analyzes an image of a gathering among friends, detects the age group of the gathering, and classifies them into groups of toddlers, teenagers, or adults.
